Project 3 README

-----------------------------

Developed and tested on Ubuntu machines at home and in the lab.

Building Instructions:
No special procedure required.  Use the provided makefile and it should work
just fine.

Scene:
This program renders a stereoscopic viewport of the scene.  It is a cross-eye
type of stereogram, so to get the 3d effect, cross your eyes until the two
images overlap and come into focus.

"Gameplay":
Your UNV (Unmanned Noclip Vehicle) is equipped with a laser targeting device.
Clicking the mouse while the view is centered on an enemy radar installation
will mark it for orbital bombardment.  Note that the on-screen reticle is 
positioned in space in front of the camera, so placing a radar station in the
middle of either of the reticles will cause a miss.  Should you click the mouse
while pointing at an invalid target, a red X will flash as indication.
